# What is Fractive?

Fractive is a hypertext authoring tool, primarily intended for the creation of interactive fiction.

Stories are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), and (optional) game logic is added with [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com). The results are kind of like [Twine](https://twinery.org/2/), but the authoring process is very different.

Fractive has three core goals:

- Keep story text readable, unencumbered by the details of scripted game logic and with minimal additional syntax
- Don't require any scripting at all for basic "choose your own adventure" style games, and use complete, standard Javascript for custom/advanced game logic
- Compile finished stories to portable HTML which can be played on any (reasonable) browser, platform, and device
